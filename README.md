# Rocket-League-based-2d-game-with-Pygame
This project is a 2D game inspired by Rocket League, developed with Pygame. The objective is to control a car to catch a ball falling from a random position at the top of the screen. Each time the player touches the ball with the car, they score points. If the ball hits the ground, the player loses a life.
